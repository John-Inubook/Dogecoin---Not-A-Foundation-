Not A Foundation procedures



To whom it may concern,

Following the live and open discussion on twitter/X spaces on August 20th (maybe early 21th for different time zones), it was by mutual agreement by those present that the Not A Foundation was created. 

This is only a draft for an attempt to identify and create solid basis to establish this project. It can be changed, modified and reviewed at will. 

Remember:



• With great fake Power comes great real Responsibility. (to quote Doge_France)



• The term « not a foundation » doesn’t necessarily imply opposition to all foundations, but rather a critical stance aimed at providing the public with accurate and transparent information about topics regarding Ðogecoin and the doge foundation. 

• The goal is to help people by informing them on different topics like legal issues that may be happening, technology, possible scams and anything else that is of public interest. Just like journalists do. 

• This is open to all who wish to contribute. 

• Every actions of “Not A Foundation” should be thoroughly reviewed and agreed upon by a general consensus. 



Below are a few key points that I think should be followed:

• Clearly outline the purpose, mission, and guiding principles of the entity. This will help establish a clear direction and attract like-minded individuals.
